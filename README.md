# PPF static site (scaffold)

This is a minimal static website scaffold created to get you started quickly.

Quick start

- Open the folder in VS Code.
- Use Live Server extension or serve with Python:

```powershell
# from the repository root
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

React (Vite) quick start

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Files
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — site styles
- script.js — tiny JS helpers

Next steps
- Customize content in `index.html` and styles in `styles.css`.
- Hook the contact form to a backend or service (Netlify, Formspree, etc.).
